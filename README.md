Dungeons & Dragons (Demo)

A demo game developed to familiarize with Unity game development:

Unity version is 2021.3.33

Luban is used for the configuration system.

Sound toggle and language switch are stored using PlayerPrefs.

Game progress is stored in JSON files.

Unity's built-in Localization and separate text configuration tables are used for multilingual support.

The aspect ratio fitter component is used for simple screen adaptation.

A simple blade particle effect is implemented.
